# RFM Analysis Online Sales Dataset

RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to analyze and categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior. The acronym RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value, which are three key dimensions used to segment and understand customer segments. Here's a brief overview of each component:

- Recency (R): This measures how recently a customer has made a purchase. Customers who have made a purchase more recently are often considered more valuable because they are likely to be active and engaged.

- Frequency (F): This measures how often a customer makes a purchase. Customers who make frequent purchases are often considered more valuable because they contribute consistently to revenue.

- Monetary Value (M): This measures the total monetary value of a customer's purchases. Customers who have spent more money are considered more valuable because they contribute significantly to the overall revenue.

By analyzing these three dimensions, businesses can segment their customer base into different groups, allowing for targeted marketing strategies
